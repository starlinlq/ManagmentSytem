# This is my header

- this is a list item
- honestly this is easy as well

### My little java program
```java
public class awesome{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello goodbye this is awesome");
    }
}
```
This is the regular text and it works well _this is in italics_ and this is **bold**
